1.array1[i]=array2[j] may not work, may have to go through a temp. 
2. linked list support is nonexistent.
3. array indices in general must be either an int literal or an int variable.
4. objects returned from a method call/list dereference must be stored in a reference before being acted upon further
5. ie: getMyList()[7]; is no good. array list; list=getMyList(); list[7]; is better.
If a var/meth name starts with a data structure name, may be a problem.
