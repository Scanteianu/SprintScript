Of immediate importance:

	-Implementing the len(), insert(), and remove() for lists, and dictionary functions (ie: put, get, contains)

Of near future importance:

	-Java API (so a sprint script program can be called like a function from an existing java program; 
	I think this is a major selling point: write your file I/O, database interfaces, etc. in Java, 
	and use Sprint Script for its simplification of functional-like concepts, 
	and then process the output in java again).
	
	-List deepclone
	
	-External library import
	
	-File I/O+Console I/O
	
	-Exceptions
	
	-Global Variables: suggested method - prefix of a global variable is global_, and that causes the switch.

Of distant future importance:
	
	-Implementing the linked lists
	
	-Decent error messages/checking functions of various types to insure they're not methods or otherwise unsafe

Conceptual goals:
	
	-Rewriting functions
